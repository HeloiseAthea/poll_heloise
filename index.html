    <center> <h2>A tool for scientists and philosophers to think about their animal models, and have conceptual keys to improve them</h2></center>

<p>
  <i> Rate my model</i> is a tool to assess the overall plausibility of your animal model regarding your question/goal of research.
        <br>
    <br> <u> <b> The evaluation comprises 3 sections to complete: </u> </p> </b>
    <ol>
        <li> <b> Qualify your model:</b> describe your research context and your scientific question by typing short text </li>
    <li> <b> Plausibility of your model:</b> rate your model and type comments
    <br> Each category of this section are subdivised in two criteria to evaluate </li>
    <li> <b> Fiability of associated data:</b> rate your experimental setup and type coments </li>
    </ol>
    <br> <b><u> Sections (2) & (3):</b></u>
    <ul>
        <li> the score of each criteria is assigned by yourself (range: -3 to 3) </li>
        <li> the score of each criteria can be <i>weighted</i> by yourself (range: 0 to 3). </li>
    Type 0 when a criteria is non applicable to your model.
    <br> 1: the importance of this criterion is low in assessing the validity of your model.
    <br> 3: the criteria is a key aspect of your model.
        <li> You can add other criteria of validity to take into account the specificity of your model. </li>
        <li> Add comments to justify each attributed score and associated weight. </li>
    </ul>
    <br> <b> RESULTS </b>: a synthetic PDF document with your inputs, and two rating figures.
    <p>
    <b> Please run the evaluation for only one model and its associated research question at a time. </b>
    <b> One evaluation : one question of research, one biological scale, one evaluator. </b>
    <br> If your model can be used to study several phenomena, please repeat the evaluation for each of the phenomena.</br>
</p>

    <p> <i> This tool is largely based on (Lemoine & Belzung, 2011), trying to extend it to basic research models. Quotations are extracted from this paper.</i> </p>

                    <br> <i> Example: for a biomedical research model aiming at testing a drug, a genetic proximity to humans and the selection of a genetic line presenting characteristics of the modeled disease could be favored (high score, hight weight).
                    <br> Conversely, this phylogenetic proximity to humans and the characteristics of the lineage will not be of much interest for a basic research model (the attributed weight could be close to 0 in thise case). </i>

                <p>
                    Pathogenic validity of a model assesses the similarity of the processes that lead to disease. We can contrast two kinds of pathognic validity:
                    <ul>
                <li> <b> Ontopathogenic validity: </b> "early environmental factors whose
                    interaction with the initial organism produces a vulnerable organism"
                <br> E.g.: "maternal care deprivation is generally considered an early environmental factor rendering
                    the subject vulnerable to depressive-like states in adulthood and, thus, has good ontopathogenic validity."</li>
                <br> <li> <b> Triggering validity: </b> "the similarity of triggering factors occurring during adulthood whose
                    interactions with either a vulnerable or an initial organism produces a pathological organism."
                <br> E.g : "a cat might elicit fear in rodents, while in humans a white bear might induce the same state.
                The two stimuli (cat and bear) are not materially identical, but have the same meaning (threat) in the rodents
                and the humans world."</li>
            </ul>
                "Etiological factors do not have to be materially similar (from a biochemical point of view), but rather
                    semantically similar (what they mean to an organism)."

                    instruments obtain the same result on the same individual.

                <p>
                 Convergent validity aims to evaluate the extent to which the measurement of a particular process, trait
                    or state through a given experimental process correlates with another measurement of the same process,
                    trait or state from another experimental process. Convergent validity seems to be one of the possible
                    ways of taking into account Pierre-Luc Germain's remark concerning the absence
                    of autonomy/self-sufficiency of experimental models (PLG, 2014) .
