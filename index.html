<h1> "Rate my model" </h1>

<h2>A tool for scientists and philosophers to think about their animal models, and have conceptual keys to improve them</h2>

<p>
  Rate my model is a tool to obtain an overall quality score for your animal model.
    <br> ==> The score of each criteria is assigned by yourself (range: -3 to 3)
    <br> ==> The score of each criteria can be weighted by taking into account your own goals (range: 0 (non applicable) to 3)
    <br> ==> You can add criteria to take into account the specificity of your model
    <br> ==> Add comments to justify each attributed score and associated weight
    <br>
    <br> RESULTS: a synthetic document with your inputs, and two rating figures.
    <p>
    <br> <u> <b> 3 sections to complete: </u> </p> </b>
    <ul>
    <li> Qualify your model: by typing short text </li>
    <li> Plausibility of your model: by rating and typing comments </li>
    <li> Fiability of associated data: by rating and typing coments </li>
    </ul>

    <b> Please run the evaluation for one research question at a time. </b>
    <b> One evaluation : one question of research, one biological scale. </b>
    <br> If your model can be used to study several phenomena, please repeat the evaluation for each of the phenomena.</br>

Conversely, this phylogenetic proximity and the characteristics of the lineage will not be of much interest for a basic research model (the attributed weight could be close to 0 in thise case). </i>

                    is or is presumed to be working in the human.
                    It refers at the same time to the mechanism that we think is producing the behavior, the biological markers or the symptoms,
                    and to the mechanism we think is sensitive to the action of effective therapeutic agents in case of a disease.
                    This mechanism can be either cognitive or neurobiological."

                    the triggering factors and the occurrence of the disease and, on the other hand, between the therapeutic
                    agent and the disease. Roughly speaking, it is the resemblance of the apparent impact of the etiological

                <p>
                    Pathogenic validity of a model assesses the similarity of the processes that lead to disease. We can contrast two kinds of pathognic validity:
                    <ul>
                <li> <b> Ontopathogenic validity: </b> early environmental factors whose
                    interaction with the initial organism produces a vulnerable organism
                <br> E.g. : "maternal care deprivation is generally considered an early environmental factor rendering the subject vulnerable to depressive-like states in adulthood and, thus, has good ontopathogenic validity."
                    "Etiological factors do not have to be materially similar (from a biochemical point of view), but rather semantically similar (what they mean to an organism)."</li>
                <br> <li> <b> Triggering validity: </b> the similarity of triggering factors occurring during adulthood whose
                    interactions with either a vulnerable or an initial organism produces a pathological organism."</li>
                E.g : "a cat might elicit fear in rodents, while in humans a white bear might induce the same state. The two stimuli (cat and bear) are not materially identical, but have the same meaning (threat) in the rodents and the humans world."

                    trait or state from another experimental process. Convergent validity seems to be one of the possible

                    of autonomy/self-sufficiency of experimental models.
